                <h4><em>Q: Are data scientists of different salary ranges satisfied with their jobs and companies?</em></h4>
                <p>The good news is, as it seems, no matter whether it be a young professional just breaking into
                   the data science world or seasoned veteran holding senior positions, data scientists, or data science
                   people, are generally feeling positive about their work and the place they are employed at. Compare
                   and contrast across three scatterplot, you can hardly observe any strong cluster that centers around
                   the negative end of company ratings, no matter the amount they are payed. So it seems there's 
                   not so much to fear about at least in the perspective of culture and experience.

                <p>First off, the scope of "industries" here is narrowed down to those that are or have been
                    posting more than 20 open data science-related positions so that this assessment of "averages"
                    can be a little more generally applicable, while also shedding some light on the industries 
                    that crave data science talents.
                    Just to spoil a little, according to our trusted source of data, the Internet industry appears
                    on top to be the most welcoming industrial-level employer to data science people with the most
                    luring compensation package. Give it a shot if you are a data scientist still out there job
                    hunting!

                <h4><em>Q: So what positions are open exactly for each industry?</em></h4>
                <p>Let's make it plain and simple with the summary here. Go be a data scientist. Everyone, 
                    literally everyone, is hiring a data scientist! If not, go be a data engineer, everyone
                    wants them too! Then, here are a few notable observation, "other" scientist (perhaps statistician, 
                    pharmacist?) is most wanted by the bio-tech world; analyst is most popular to the insurance world.
                    However, not everything is perfect. For instance, if you were to pursue the career of a machine learning 
                    engineer, it would be a long way ahead.

                <p>The more saturated a region is, the more positions are open and hosted in that state. More specifically, 
                    the larger and more saturated a circle is, the more positions are available at that city! Don't you 
                    always dream of working by the beach and under the sunshine, or working next to the Times Square and 
                    get your lunch break at some fancy restaurants on top of Rockafeller? Well, it's totally good news to
                    you since San Francisco, California and New York City, New York are definitely under the radar here.
